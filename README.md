Do you no longer trust tech monopolies with your data?<br/>
Are you done with your privacy being invaded by advertisers? <br/>
Are you tired of being abused by Big Companies?

**We are too. So, we built Bloom.**

Bloom is an open source and privacy-focused productivity suite: Inbox, Calendar, Files, Contacts &
much more. **It's literally the easiest way to de-Google your life and business**.
